## 🧩 API Design

The AI layer has two core functions:

- **`generateMindMap(topic)`** — creates a full structured tree from a topic string
- **`expandNode(label)`** — takes a single node label and returns 4–5 deep subtopics

Both return a typed `MindMapNode` tree and gracefully fall back to offline defaults if the API is unavailable.
